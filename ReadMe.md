# Fast31 - SwiftUI Movie Browser App (MVVM)

## Architecture

**Fast31** follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture, which ensures separation of concerns and a clean structure:

- **Model**: Defines the data structures and represents the business logic.
- **View**: SwiftUI views that render the UI and handle user interactions.
- **ViewModel**: Manages business logic, data transformation, and communication between the Model and the View.

This architecture promotes **scalability**, **testability**, and **maintainability**, making it easier to manage UI state and network operations.

### **Diagram**
Below is a visual representation of the **MVVM** architecture used in this project.
